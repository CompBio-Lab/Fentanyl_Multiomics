# Differential State Analysis

Pseudobulk differential state analysis using *muscat* was conducted on three different datasets; GEX, ATAC and Gene Activity (GA). The tutorial followed can be found here: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/muscat/inst/doc/analysis.html. 

*Muscat* provides various methods of visualization for the differential state analysis in multi-sample, multi-group, multi-(cell)-subpopulation single cell data. We saved the output top table for pathway analysis.
