# Spatial Analysis (CosMx Nanostring Spatial Molecular Imager)

To start analysing the spatial data, we first created a seurat object using the fov annotations and raw data obtained from Nanostring. Then, we followed the same clustering and annotation process as the 10x multiome analysis. 

Next, we looked at which cell types were common between the 10x multiome and spatial dataset. These were then labelled on the tissue slide.
