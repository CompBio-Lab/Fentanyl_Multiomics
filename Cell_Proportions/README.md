# Cell Proportions 

In order to understand the differences in cell proportions within our dataset we used scCODA, which takes a Bayseian approach to address the low-replicate issue commonly seen in single-cell analysis. The tutorial used can be found here: https://pertpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/notebooks/sccoda.html

To run scCODA, our dockerfile / docker image can be used. It contains all the required packages.
